# Survival Analysis of Patients with Diabetic Retinopathy

## What is Survival Analysis?
Survival Analysis 

## Data We Used
The data we used comes from R's *survival* package under *diabetic* dataframe,
which contains partial results from a trial of laser coagulation for the treatment
of diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy is caused by damage to the blood vessels
of the retina, which can lead to blindness ([details](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetic-retinopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20371611)). 

## Models and Methods Used
In our study, we are interested in finding out which parameters contribute to the patient blindness and which do not. We used three methods to identify those parameters:
- **Kaplan-Meier Curve**: shows the probability of the event at a certain time using a single categorical variable as shown below:

  * 
- Cox
